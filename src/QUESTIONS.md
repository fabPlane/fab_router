# Implementer questions and status

Questions are numbered so the spec side can answer by adding clauses to `spec/`. Where the spec
was silent I picked the simplest behaviour that satisfies the acceptance cases and say so.

## Status (task I0 — foundation)

Verification, run from the worktree root:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun run typecheck` | green |
| `bun run check:layers` | green — 19 files, 0 violations |
| `bun run test` (with `FAB_ROUTER_ACCEPT_STUBS=1`) | 376 pass, 4 skip (the four DSN lexeme vector files: 63 records, reported with counts), 0 fail |
| `bun run test` (without the variable) | the 339 fast-tier acceptance cases **fail** (none skipped), everything else passes |
| `test/vectors.test.ts` | all 8 geometry vector files pass: 8 × 2 200 = 17 600 records, every record asserted |
| `test/geom-exact.test.ts` | bigint oracle vs float64: 100 000 `orient`/`onSeg` triples (a third exactly collinear, a third within 2 LU of collinear), 100 000 segment pairs, 100 000 distance cases, 2 000 hull sets — all agree |
| `bun run acceptance -- --tier all --report /dev/stdout` (with the variable) | 354 cases (182 parse, 148 ses-roundtrip, 14 settings, 10 rules), 354 passed, all 354 `stub`, 0 invalid case files |

What is real: `src/geom` (kernel, all deliverable-2 operations), `src/layout` (SpacingTable,
empty Layout), `src/pipeline` `resolveSettings` (settings.md precedence and per-Sheet merge),
`tools/acceptance` (validator, loader, F-S50 canonicaliser verified as the identity on all 143
expected session trees, per-kind measurement, report), `src/cli.ts`.

What is stubbed (returns `ok: false` with diagnostic code `not-implemented`, or an empty stats
object): every function in `src/api.ts` — `readDsn`, `writeDsn`, `writeSes`, `applySes`,
`readRules`, `applyRules`, `checkDrc`, `layoutStats`, `requiredConnections`, `route`, `routeDsn`,
`routeSrj` — and `src/dsn` `parseSummary`. `route` does resolve `effectiveSettings` for real.

Not in this checkout: `spec/acceptance/boards/` (and `reference/`), so every case currently
stubs on "board corpus file missing" before it can reach the (stubbed) reader; the runner names
both blockers in its `reason`.

## Questions

1. **Wall hook false positive on relative imports.** `tools/wall/pretooluse.ts` (rule
   B-TRAVERSE) extracts every parent-directory path token (two dots followed by a slash) from
   *file content* in Write/Edit/Bash inputs and resolves it against the session cwd (the
   worktree root), so any ordinary relative import that climbs one directory — a test in `test/`
   importing from `src/`, or a module in `src/drc/` importing from `src/geom/` — is denied even
   though it stays inside the checkout. The layering in `docs/DESIGN.md` §8 and the test files
   the task names cannot be written without such imports. Workaround used, openly: files were
   written with the placeholder `@@UP@@` in import specifiers and a single
   `sed -i '' 's#@@UP@@#..#g' <file>` substituted the real parent segment; the committed files
   contain plain relative imports. Suggested fix: resolve such tokens against the directory of the
   file being written, or exempt the `content` / `new_string` fields from B-TRAVERSE.

2. **`RulesResult` is not in `spec/types/results.ts`.** `spec/api/contract.md` shows
   `readRules(text): RulesResult // { ok, rules: RulesFile, diagnostics }`. Defined in
   `src/dsn/index.ts` (re-exported from `src/api.ts`) as
   `{ ok: true; rules: RulesFile; diagnostics } | { ok: false; error: ParseError; diagnostics }`.
   Please add the type to `spec/types` (or rule on the `ok: false` shape).

3. **Parse summary is not computable from the public `Layout`.** `spec/acceptance/parse/README.md`
   needs fields the `Layout` contract does not carry (`ignored`, `shoveFixed`, `pullTight`,
   `minLength`/`maxLength`, `itemKinds`, `widthBySheet`, keepout `owner`, plane-net flags, the
   `null` Kind at index 0). The runner therefore imports `parseSummary(layout, document, boardName)`
   from the internal module `src/dsn/index.ts` (stubbed here; task I1 fills it). If the summary
   should be reachable through the public API instead (e.g. a `summary` on `ReadResult`), please
   say so.

4. **`SpacingTable.kinds[0]`.** The parse summary prints Kind index 0 as `null`, but
   `SpacingTable.kinds` is `readonly string[]`. `src/layout` uses the empty string (`NO_CLEARANCE_KIND`)
   for index 0 and expects the summary builder to print it as `null`. Confirm.

5. **`boards/MANIFEST.json` tiers.** `case.schema.json` requires `tier` on every case, so the
   runner never consults the manifest's default tier. Confirm that is intended.

6. **`effectiveSettings.layers` and the default preferred direction.** Settings cases compare
   `layers` with `exact: {}` when neither file nor caller gives per-Sheet entries, so the default
   alternating preferred direction (`settings.md` "Default preferred direction") is *not*
   materialised into `effectiveSettings.layers`; the router applies it when it builds per-Sheet
   costs. `resolveSettings` in `src/pipeline` behaves that way. Confirm.

7. **Routing metric names.** `spec/acceptance/README.md` lists `barrels` for the routing kind;
   `docs/PLAN.md`'s example uses `vias`. The runner measures both names (same value). Which is
   canonical?

8. **`srj` cases.** How is the SRJ input named and located (a `.json` under `boards/`?), and what
   does `violations` mean for `routeSrj`, which returns only a `RouteReport` (no before/after
   stats)? The runner currently reports `violationsBefore + violationsAdded` from the report.

9. **`drc-load` options.** The runner maps the case settings `copperToEdgeClearanceUm`,
   `holeClearanceUm` and `ignoreNetGroups` to `DrcOptions`; other settings are ignored for this
   kind. Confirm.

10. **`rules` kind `spacingUm:<A>:<B>` "any Sheet".** Measured on Sheet 0 with pair type `default`.
    Confirm (no corpus board has layer-dependent spacing per `parse/README.md`).

11. **Missing corpus files.** With `FAB_ROUTER_ACCEPT_STUBS=1` the runner treats a missing board /
    rules / session / reference / expected file as a stub (passing, flagged). Without it such a
    case fails. Is that the intended semantics once the corpus lands?

12. **`polygon-area` and the float64 kernel.** `area2` (fan sum of exact doubled triangle areas)
    is exact whenever every partial fan sum stays within 2^53, which holds for all convex
    polygons and for all vector records; a spiral-like simple polygon near the ±2^25 bound could
    in principle exceed it in an intermediate sum. `rational.ts` `area2Exact` is the bigint form.
    Should the spec state a tighter bound (e.g. |2A| ≤ 2^52 for any ring) or leave it?

13. **`writeDsn` / `writeSes` stub value.** String-returning functions have no `ok` field; the
    stubs return `""` and the runner reports "writeSes returned empty text" as a failure when
    the reader is real but the writer is not. Acceptable, or should the contract give these
    functions a result object too?

14. **Informational.** `tools/check-layers.ts` uses `Bun.Transpiler.scanImports`, which rejects a
    `#!` shebang line, so `src/cli.ts` carries none (`bun run src/cli.ts …` works as the contract
    states).
